    Scenario: As an editor, I can create and update a resource with an uploaded validation schema
        Given "TestOrgEditor" as the persona
        When I log in
        And I create a dataset with key-value parameters "notes=Test uploaded schema"
        And I open the new resource form for dataset "$last_generated_name"
        And I upload "test.csv" of type "CSV" to resource
        And I fill in "name" with "Test validation schema"
        And I fill in "description" with "Testing validation schema"
        And I upload schema file "test_schema.json" to resource
        And I press the element with xpath "//button[contains(@class, 'btn-primary')]"
        Then I should see "Test validation schema" within 2 seconds

        And I press the element with xpath "//div[contains(@class, 'action')]//a[contains(@href, '/resource/') and contains(@href, '/edit')]"
